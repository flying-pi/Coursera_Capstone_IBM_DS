# Business Problem
### Setting:
Management of the tour agency realizes, that there is a big amount of the customers, which ask to "Something different". This type of customer doesn't want to use some popular tours and asks to give something, that doesn't look like to their usual life. But this request is the big challenge for agency staff because usually, they work with something like "I want to sea rest" or "I want the trip to old Europe" or "I prefer mountains". But,  in this case, they must find something, which something different. 
### Proposed solution:
Start a new type of tour "Variable environment is the best rest" 
### Ð¡hallenge: 
There are only several specialists can provide this service. 
### Final decision: 
Create an app, which recommends most unlike place, to the user location. 


# Used Data
To set up a list of the available places we will use this dataset https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities. It provides a list of the different cities, which can be a potential candidate for the trip. For start company Tourist Agency decide to restrict all possible variants only to Ukrainian cities(I living in Ukraine, and also it is the good way to reduce the amount of the data and keep request limit). For build a picture of each location, Foursquare data will be used. It allows the founding most popular type of venue in each location. And as result app propose a place, which most unlike to the set place.
